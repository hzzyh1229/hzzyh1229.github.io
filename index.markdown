# Yihan Zhang

I'm an MEng student in [Computer Science at](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/) Cornell University. I also obtained my Bachelor of Arts degree with Computer Science major at Cornell. 

My interests lie broadly, from computer graphics, game architecture, to machine learning and software frameworks. Ouside my academic studies, I love traveling, learning languages (I can speak Chinese, English, Japanese, and I'm learning French now!), musicals and collecting enamel pins.
